A package to compute quaternionic Darmon points.

Here there is simple example. Look at example.sage for a more detailed calculation.

    sage: load('shpquat.sage')
    sage: E = EllipticCurve('78a1')
    sage: p = 13 # Must divide the conductor of E
    sage: dK = 5 # The discriminant of the real quadratic field.
    sage: prec = 20 # Precision to which result is desired
    sage: outfile = 'points_%s_%s.txt'%(p,E.cremona_label()) # Optional
    sage: darmon_point(p,E,dK,prec,outfile = outfile)

The package is capable of computing the classical Darmon (a.k.a. Stark-Heegner) points:

    sage: load('shpquat.sage')
    sage: E = EllipticCurve('35a1')
    sage: p = 7 # Must divide the conductor of E
    sage: dK = 41 # The discriminant of the real quadratic field.
    sage: prec = 20 # Precision to which result is desired
    sage: outfile = 'points_%s_%s.txt'%(p,E.cremona_label()) # Optional
    sage: darmon_point(p,E,dK,prec,outfile = outfile)
